## Overlays {#overlays}

In addition to imagery from Google Maps and Bing Maps, user can also upload overlays to HelioScope. Often this is enhanced imagery or site layouts for a building that has not yet been built. By turning their imagery into a KMZ or KML file, users can upload any image to HelioScope to use as the background of their design. The HelioScope SketchUp plugin can also be used to upload imagery.
