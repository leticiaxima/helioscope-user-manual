2.  The blue progress bar shows the status of active simulations, and how far they are away from completion
3.  Completed Reports are shown with a blue button. Click to view the detailed Report
4.  The metric shown on the completed Reports can be set to kWh/kWp, Performance Ratio, or Energy (total generation) for quick comparison between simulations.
